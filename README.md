# 📊 International Student Mental Health Analysis

🎯 Project Objective
This project explores a dataset from a Japanese international university to analyze the relationship between an international student's length of stay (stay) and their mental health diagnostic scores. Specifically, it examines scores for:

PHQ-9 (todep): Depression severity.

SCS (tosc): Social connectedness.

ASISS (toas): Acculturative stress (stress from adapting to a new culture).

🛠️ Technical Skills Used
SQL (PostgreSQL): Utilized advanced querying techniques including:

GROUP BY for data aggregation.

WHERE clauses to filter for international students (inter_dom = 'Inter').

ROUND() and AVG() functions for statistical cleaning.

ORDER BY for logical data presentation.

Data Analysis: Interpreting trends across different durations of stay.
